Challenge Hub
=======================

**Live Demo**: https://flowing-lead-275304.uk.r.appspot.com/

In the COVID world, we’re seeing lots of companies and influencers are giving their followers challenges (try new at-home exercises, try a plant-based diet), sometimes with raffle rewards, or sometimes just for fun. We want to make a platform where someone can specify certain parameters for their challenge (name, description, challenge, participation criteria, prize, duration), and we’ll generate a challenge page for them. They can then take the link for their challenge page and share it on their Instagram, Twitter, etc. 

Each challenge page will be interactive, including a form for people to post updates of their challenge milestones. These responses populate a feed of submissions from all challenge participants, and may include photos, text updates, videos, etc. 

The users of this project could span from an individual making a challenge for their friends to a company hosting a challenge for marketing.

We imagine a home page that lists trending challenges, and challenge pages that provide useful utilities to the challenge hoster (like file upload if your challenge requires photos) as well as entertainment (feed, thread, etc.)
